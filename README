µSync is a general purpose synchronization library, based on being small and
lightweight. It requires very little RAM, and is quite fast.
The following functions _must_ be implemented:
 * malloc
 * free
 * memcmp
 * memcpy
 * memset

At last measurement, minimum requirements were:
8bytes of RAM per sync object. (12bytes on default config)
1156 bytes for code. (Darwin x86)
1600 bytes for code. (PPC)
1760 bytes for code. (ARM)
